This module allows you to review all your classes
(templates) used on a website.

It has a page type that lists all templates used on the website.

You can also include a footer on every page with information about the template being used.

When logged-in as admin, the TemplateDevelopment template include allows you to
visit the front-end of the website and:

1. upload and view designs
2. link through to edit page in the CMS
3. review stats (last changed, etc... for the template).
